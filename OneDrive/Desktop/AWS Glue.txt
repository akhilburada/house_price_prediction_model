AWS Glue ETL Jobs
What It Is: A job that automatically extracts data, transforms it (e.g., cleans or formats it), and loads it into another location.
How It Works: You create a script (in Python or Scala) to perform these tasks. You can write it yourself or use Glue Studio to generate it.
Example: You have raw sales data in Amazon S3, and you want to clean it and put it into Amazon Redshift for analysis. An ETL job does this for you.
AWS Glue Studio
What It Is: A visual tool to create and manage ETL jobs without needing to write code.
How It Works: You use a drag-and-drop interface to design how data should be processed.
Example: Instead of writing a script, you drag and drop elements to set up how you want to clean and transform your data.
AWS Glue DataBrew
What It Is: A visual tool for cleaning and preparing data.
How It Works: You interactively apply transformations and cleaning steps to your data without writing code.
Example: If you have messy data, you use DataBrew to clean it up by removing errors and formatting it correctly.
AWS Glue Workflows
What It Is: A way to manage and automate a sequence of ETL tasks.
How It Works: You set up a workflow that defines the order and dependencies of multiple ETL jobs and other tasks.
Example: You can create a workflow to first update metadata with a crawler, then clean data with an ETL job, and finally load the data into a database.
AWS Glue Triggers
What It Is: Mechanisms that start ETL jobs based on specific conditions or schedules.
How It Works: Triggers automatically run jobs when something happens, like when new data arrives or at a scheduled time.
Example: You set a trigger to start a data cleaning job every night or whenever new data is added to an S3 bucket.
